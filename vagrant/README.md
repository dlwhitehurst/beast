# vagrant

This readme describes how to prepare and provision a Kubernetes cluster of
VirtualBox Ubuntu 22.04 machines. Other VMs will probably be integrated into
this repository but for now, we stick to Ubuntu.

Before you can run the Vagrant file, you need to be sure that the following
prerequisites are satisfied:

1. VirtualBox
2. Vagrant

Once installed, you can run `vagrant up` and provision a Kubernetes cluster 
of Ubuntu machines on Bare-Metal.

## Prerequisites
Be sure to install VirtualBox and Vagrant
